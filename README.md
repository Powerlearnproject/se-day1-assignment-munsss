Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of developing,designing,testing and deployment of software applications by adhering to a set of engineering principles. Itâ€™s important in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that help to solve a real world problem.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in software engineering include :
The development of programming languages for example C programming language 
The establishment of Software engineering principles
The rise of agile methodologies 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements gathering and documentation - done to understand the needs of the user and system requirements.
Design - creating a detailed design of the software to be created
Implementation - building the software according to the design specification provided 
Testing - conducting tests to ensure the software meets the set standards.
Deployment - releasing the software to the user.
Maintenance - providing support and enhancements on the software when required after the deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach whereby one must complete each phase before proceeding on to the next. It is compared to a waterfall because the progress flows downwards.
Agile methodology is an iterative process where projects are broken into smaller manageable units whereby each unit goes through different phases i.e planning,development and testing.
Both of these have a structured approach ensuring the tasks are completed in a systematic approach.
The differences in these methodologies include;
Flexibility - waterfall methodology is not flexible as the requirements do not change as the project progresses whereas the agile methodology is very flexible and adjustments can be made throughout the project.
Waterfall uses a sequential approach whereas agile uses an iterative approach.
 The waterfall methodology is suitable for small scale projects with well defined requirements while agile methodology is suitable for complex and evolving projects which requires collaboration with the stakeholders and the customer for feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer - is responsible for writing the code and implementing software solutions throughout the project.
Quality assurance engineer - ensures and validates the quality of the software by coming up with test plans.
Project manager - oversees the planning and execution of projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development environments (IDEs) enhance productivity by providing code writing environments and debugging tools to help with the development process.
Version Control systems are also important because the foster collaboration among developers and also offer a backup and recovery mechanism in case of code changes.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common challenges faced by software engineers include changing of requirements during the development cycle which causes project delays. Pressure to meet a deadline can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Strategies of overcoming challenges include effective communication, prioritization of tasks and regular assessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of individual components of the software.
Integration testing is testing how different components in the system interact with each other.
Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
 The importance of these is that it assures continuous testing and helps identify and fix defects early in the development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting or statements to get the best answer from Ai models. Its importance is that it helps you get clear and consise answers from Ai models rather than vague and wrong answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example asking "tell me a historical event" rather you should ask "give me a historical event that took place in kenya in the year 1963" this gives a better response.
